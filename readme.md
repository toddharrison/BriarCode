# BriarCode Plugins Repo
This repository serves as the root for all the public plugins for the BriarCraft SMP server. Each plugin submodule has
its own readme containing more information and usage about that particular plugin. Below are some quick links for
convenience.

## Plugins
* [kotlin](../../tree/main/kotlin): Base plugin for Kotlin language support
* [fake-block](../../tree/main/fake-block): Client-side only blocks
* [fake-block-api](../../tree/main/fake-block-api): API for integrating with fake-block

## Plugin Releases
Download the latest plugin releases below, or use the [releases](../../releases) link at right to download specific versions.
* [kotlin-1.7.21.1](../../releases/download/kotlin-1.7.21.1/kotlin-1.7.21.1.jar)
* [fake-block-1.0.1](../../releases/download/fake-block-1.0.0/fake-block-1.0.1.jar)
* [fake-block-api-1.0](../../releases/download/fake-block-1.0.0/fake-block-api-1.0.jar)

## Latest Builds
Under [actions](../../actions) above you can download snapshot builds of plugins, if available, in the artifacts section of each build.

## Developer
Look in [buildSrc](../../tree/main/buildSrc) for some of my development notes. Usage of plugin APIs will be included in their own readmes.
