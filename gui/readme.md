# BriarCode GUI Plugin
This Spigot plugin allows the creation of user interfaces using the inventory containers in Minecraft. They do not show
the player's contents, so all the slots may be utilized. Placing items in inventory also does not cause the player to
receive achievements or recipes for those items. The slots are organized into logical panels: top, mid, and nav.

More documentation is TODO.
